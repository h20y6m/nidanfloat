# nidanfloat

This package enables bottom (`b`) placement option
for double float in two column mode (nidan-kumi).
This package was originally part of Japanese pLaTeX,
and now is distributed as a separate package because
it supports all LaTeX formats.
The package was originally developed by ASCII MEDIA WORKS,
and now maintained by Japanese TeX Development Community.

## Changes from the original ASCII edition
